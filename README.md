=========
Designed for SE350 weekly quizzes.

input.txt is what makeQuestion.py would use as input.
I guess you can modify the code to make it pass in an arbitrary file, but I am not going to do that. Unless I feel like it one day.

You to strickly follow the format in input.txt
Compile using command 'python makeQuestion.py'
Output is FileName.csv
FileName is the first line in input.txt
